# eurus-fabric-playbooks
A set of Fabric scripts for orchestrating a hyper-converged Ceph + OpenStack + Kubernetes cluster.

## Ceph

Navigate to [`ceph/centos7/README.md`](https://github.com/rudimk/eurus-fabric-playbooks/blob/master/ceph/centos7/README.md) for instructions on deploying a Ceph cluster on CentOS 7. Ubuntu 18.04 playbooks are coming soon!

## OpenStack

OpenStack deployment playbooks are stull under development, and will be made available shortly. In the meantime, feel free to browse through our [guides](https://github.com/rudimk/eurus-fabric-playbooks/tree/master/openstack#guides).

## K3s

Check out [`k3s/ubuntu18/README.md`](https://github.com/rudimk/eurus-fabric-playbooks/blob/master/k3s/ubuntu18/README.md) to deploy a nice little K3s cluster on Ubuntu 18.04.
